    This edition of Thomas Brussig's <em>Am kürzeren Ende der Sonnenallee</em> is 
    designed to overlay personal and public accounts of key events during the
    period of 1945-1990 that are referenced in the novel. It links keywords
    in the text to digitized primary sources containing both public and 
    private accounts of these events to complement fictional accounts from the 
    novel. These sources are pre-loaded into Voyant for easy visualization and
    statistical anlysis. This range of fictional, non-fictional, public, and 
    private perspectives helps convey a rich and multi-layered understanding
    of life in the GDR.
